# CSES

My solutions to the [CSES](https://cses.fi/problemset/) problem set.

## Why?

I like cool problems. I decided to publish it in case someone needs to review my leetcode skills. I don't like leetcode specifically since it is often really boring, but olimpiad problems get my cogs running better.

## Why this and not X?

The problems are not about grinding datastructures, they are about solving actually interesting problems, so kudos to the authors.

## What are the READMEs?

The README contains an explanation of my thinking proces separated into attempts. Each attempt is one time I sat down with the problem and made some meaningful progress.
